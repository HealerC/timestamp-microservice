Freecodecamp on apis and microservices that when the user provides the date on api endpoint (like [project url]/api/timestamp/2015-12-25 or [project url]/api/timestamp/1451001600000), the server responds with a json document with the data in UTC form and in Unix form (number of seconds since unix time 1st January, 1970).

Additionally there is a form which does same thing. It contains two input elements that can be used to send in the date in standard form or in unix form.
